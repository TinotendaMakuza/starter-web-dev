            Firstly, A bit About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Web Development is not something I initially saw myself doing at all. I found it frivolous and meaningless. I preferred
            the idea of backend programming, particularly C++. I liked creating systems, simulating the real-world and having 
            functions and objects that I created interact with each other in interesting ways.

            Then I landed my first software internship and found myself faced with the task of creating a website. Dismayed, but 
            never one to back down from a challenge, I gracefully accepted. Though not knowing the first thing about web development 
            I bravely ploughed on. 

            I went from following along developers on YouTube, to Design with Figma, to free online tutorials by Mozilla. What
            I expected to take a week or 2, has taken me 3 months with nothing to show for it. But I trudge on, for now I have forgotten 
            about the results and have fallen in love with the process, which I will be sharing the very basics with you now.
