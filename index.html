            Firstly, A bit About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Web Development is not something I initially saw myself doing at all. I found it frivolous and meaningless. I preferred
            the idea of backend programming, particularly C++. I liked creating systems, simulating the real-world and having 
            functions and objects that I created interact with each other in interesting ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I landed my first software internship and found myself faced with the task of creating a website. Dismayed, but 
            never one to back down from a challenge, I gracefully accepted. Though not knowing the first thing about web development 
            I bravely ploughed on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I went from following along developers on YouTube, to Design with Figma, to free online tutorials by Mozilla. What
            I expected to take a week or 2, has taken me 3 months with nothing to show for it. But I trudge on, for now I have forgotten 
            about the results and have fallen in love with the process, which I will be sharing the very basics with you now.

            HTML is a markup language used to define the structure of a webpage by giving semantics to its content. 
            It involves enclosing content in tags to influence its appearance and behaviour.

            CSS is a stylesheet language used to style HTML elements. CSS uses the box model to represent and effect elements 
            Each element is (or can be) a box with padding, a border and margin around the content.

        <p class="Javascript-Basics">
            Javascript is a programming language that adds interactivity to a webpage. Javascript uses the DOM which is a representation 
            of the data structures that make up a website and all the entities. In Javascript, everything is an object thus probably making 
            it highly object-oriented.
